# reu-2025

This repository contains the materials used for the GNU Radio tutorials
of the Breakthrough Listen Research Experience for Undergraduates 2024.

## Outline

* Session 1. [introduction-slides](introduction-slides). Introductory slides for
  the tutorials.

* Session 1. [rtlsdr](rtlsdr). Example showing how to receive signals with the
  RTL-SDR in GNU Radio.

* Session 1. [audio](audio). Example showing how to generate and display audio
  (soundcard) signals with GNU Radio.

* Session 2. [iq-sampling](iq-sampling). Explanation about why IQ (complex)
  sampling is useful and very common in digital signal processing.

* Session 2. [spectral-analysis](spectral-analysis). Generation of narrowband
  and wideband signals in AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise). CN0. Spectrum
  estimation with an averaged FFT.

* Session 3. [voyager1](voyager1). Spectral analysis and data decoding of a
  Voyager-1 recording done with Green Bank Telescope. Uses the file
  [vgr1_blc23_guppi_59046_80036_DIAG_VOYAGER-1_0011.cs8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11PoypHt2f5ISyBfSpLGBejysiW_CPkC7/view?usp=sharing)
  (1.7GB).

* Session 3. [fm-broadcast](fm-broadcast). FM broadcast receiver with the
  RTL-SDR (mono and stereo). Short recording
  [fm_broadcast_recording_20240615.c64](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IYZR0OuF6bcwVwT2uuooNaWP3lGyI4zb/view?usp=sharing)
  (245MB) to allow following along without an RTL-SDR (or without any FM
  broadcast stations available).
